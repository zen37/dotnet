# Event Driven

## Message Brokers

Azure provides equivalent services to RabbitMQ and Kafka, tailored for different messaging and event-streaming needs. Here's a comparison of RabbitMQ and Kafka with their Azure counterparts:

---

### **1. RabbitMQ Equivalent in Azure**
#### **Azure Service Bus**
- **Description**: A fully managed enterprise messaging service designed for reliable and asynchronous message delivery.
- **Features**:
  - Supports advanced routing with topics and subscriptions.
  - Provides FIFO (First In, First Out) message delivery.
  - Offers dead-letter queues for handling failed messages.
  - Supports message batching, sessions, and transactions.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Complex message routing, transactional systems.
  - Reliable messaging between microservices or distributed systems.

#### **Azure Event Grid** *(Optional for event-driven systems)*:
- **Description**: A fully managed event routing service.
- **Features**:
  - Event-based, push-only delivery.
  - Integrates well with other Azure services.
  - Supports filtering and advanced event routing.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Event-driven systems, real-time notifications, lightweight message distribution.

### **2. Kafka Equivalent in Azure**
#### **Azure Event Hubs**
- **Description**: A big data streaming platform and event ingestion service, designed to handle millions of events per second.
- **Features**:
  - Distributed log-based architecture similar to Kafka.
  - Supports Kafka APIs, enabling Kafka-based applications to work without modification.
  - Provides message retention for up to 90 days.
  - Offers replay capability by setting consumer offsets.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Event streaming, telemetry ingestion, real-time analytics, log aggregation.
  - High-throughput scenarios like IoT and big data pipelines.

#### **Azure Data Explorer** *(Optional for analytics)*:
- **Description**: A fast, fully managed data analytics service that integrates with Event Hubs.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Advanced analytics on streaming data.

### **When to Use Each in Azure?**
- **Use Azure Service Bus (RabbitMQ Equivalent):**
  - When you need reliable message delivery with advanced routing.
  - For building microservices-based systems with transactional needs.
  - For applications requiring message ordering and dead-lettering.

- **Use Azure Event Hubs (Kafka Equivalent):**
  - When dealing with high-throughput, large-scale event streaming.
  - For real-time data pipelines, telemetry ingestion, and big data processing.
  - When you need message replay and long-term retention.



# Services

A service class acts as a layer between the client (e.g., your controllers or API endpoints) and the storage layer (e.g., your repositories or data access classes). This service layer encapsulates business logic and ensures that your application follows the single responsibility principle, making it more maintainable and testable.
