### Table Comparison of Synchronization Primitives

| Feature                       | `lock` (Monitor)                         | `Mutex`                                     | `Semaphore`                                | `AutoResetEvent`                          | `ManualResetEvent`                        | `ReaderWriterLockSlim`                    | `SpinLock`                                | `Barrier`                                 | `CountdownEvent`                          |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                   | Ensures exclusive access to a resource within a process. | Provides mutual exclusion within or across processes. | Limits the number of threads that can access a resource concurrently. | Signals one waiting thread upon a state change. | Signals all waiting threads until manually reset. | Allows multiple readers or one writer access to a resource. | Low-overhead locking for short-lived tasks. | Synchronizes multiple threads at a specific point. | Blocks until its count reaches zero.     |
| **Scope**                     | Within the same process.                 | Can work across processes.                 | Within or across processes (with named Semaphores). | Within the same process.                  | Within the same process.                  | Within the same process.                  | Within the same process.                  | Within the same process.                  | Within the same process.                  |
| **Locking Mechanism**         | Implicitly acquires and releases with `lock` keyword. | Explicit acquisition (`WaitOne`) and release (`ReleaseMutex`). | Acquired with `WaitOne` and released with `Release`. | Blocks threads and automatically resets after one thread is released. | Blocks threads but remains signaled until manually reset. | Supports reader/writer locks for finer-grained control. | Busy-wait loop until the lock is acquired. | Blocks threads until all participants have arrived. | Decrements a count and blocks until it reaches zero. |
| **Use Case**                  | Simple thread synchronization within a process. | Cross-process synchronization.             | Throttling access to limited resources.   | Thread signaling; releasing one thread at a time. | Thread signaling; releasing all threads at once. | High read frequency, low write frequency scenarios. | High-performance scenarios for very short critical sections. | Synchronizing threads at specific phases. | Waiting for multiple tasks to complete.   |
| **Blocking Behavior**         | Blocks if the lock is held.             | Blocks if the Mutex is acquired.           | Blocks if all slots are occupied.         | Blocks until signaled.                    | Blocks until signaled.                    | Blocks readers if a writer is active and vice versa. | Busy-waits (spins) until lock is free.   | Blocks until all participants reach it.   | Blocks until the count reaches zero.     |
| **Reentrancy Support**        | Supports reentrancy (a thread can re-enter). | Supports reentrancy (same thread can re-acquire). | No reentrancy.                            | No reentrancy.                            | No reentrancy.                            | No reentrancy.                            | No reentrancy.                            | N/A                                       | N/A                                       |
| **Ownership**                 | Owned by the thread that acquired it.    | Owned by the acquiring thread.             | No ownership; any thread can release it.  | No ownership; any thread can signal.      | No ownership; any thread can signal.      | N/A (depends on reader/writer role).      | No ownership (busy-waiting primitive).    | N/A (used for thread coordination).       | N/A (used for thread coordination).       |
| **Cross-Process Capability**  | No                                      | Yes                                       | Yes (with named Semaphores).              | No                                        | No                                        | No                                        | No                                        | No                                        | No                                        |
| **Performance**               | Lightweight (intra-process only).       | Heavier due to kernel object overhead.     | Medium, dependent on slot contention.     | Medium.                                   | Medium.                                   | Good for reader-heavy workloads.          | High performance, but CPU-intensive if contention exists. | Moderate; depends on participant count.   | Moderate; depends on count and waiting threads.   |
| **Syntax**                    | `lock(obj) { /* critical section */ }`  | `mutex.WaitOne(); /* critical section */ mutex.ReleaseMutex();` | `semaphore.WaitOne(); /* critical section */ semaphore.Release();` | `autoResetEvent.WaitOne(); /* critical section */ autoResetEvent.Set();` | `manualResetEvent.WaitOne(); /* critical section */ manualResetEvent.Set();` | `rwLock.EnterReadLock(); /* read */ rwLock.ExitReadLock(); rwLock.EnterWriteLock(); /* write */ rwLock.ExitWriteLock();` | `spinLock.Enter(); /* critical section */ spinLock.Exit();` | `barrier.SignalAndWait(); /* critical section */` | `countdownEvent.Signal(); countdownEvent.Wait();` |

### Key Takeaways:
- **`lock`** and **`Mutex`** are good for exclusive access to a resource, with `Mutex` supporting cross-process scenarios.
- **`Semaphore`** can limit access to multiple threads, while a **`SemaphoreSlim`** offers lighter-weight control within a process.
- **`AutoResetEvent`** and **`ManualResetEvent`** are signaling primitives for thread coordination.
- **`ReaderWriterLockSlim`** is optimal when read-heavy access patterns are needed.
- **`SpinLock`** is fast but should be used cautiously to avoid wasting CPU resources.
- **`Barrier`** and **`CountdownEvent`** help synchronize groups of threads in different coordination patterns.
